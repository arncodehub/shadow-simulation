# shadow-simulation
It is a simulation of changing shadows throughout the day, as the sun moves.

It takes a total of two minutes in real time, to show the sun cycle to its original position.

The shadows are simply just locations that are absent of light.

There is a decent amount of time, with no light, at night, when the sun is under the bottom of the screen.

The sun is not always on screen, but you can almost always see its light, but sometimes it is completely dark during night.

The moon is not supported, and there is no "reddish" sunrise/sunset color tint, as there is no atmosphere supported here.
